## Problem

### Delete From

The  **DELETE FROM**  statement is used to remove one or multiple rows from a table.
You can use the statement when you want to delete existing records.

Below is the query to delete all rows in the student table with student_id - 08 (table added below for reference).

```
DELETE FROM  student
WHERE student_id = 08;

```

### Task

Write a query which does the following

- Delete all rows in the employee table whose Department is 'Hr'.
- Output all the entires of the table
- Original table has the following rows

```
┌─────────────┬────────────────┬────────────┐
│ Employee_id │ Employee_Name  │ Department │
├─────────────┼────────────────┼────────────┤
│ 1           │ Kayla Thompson │ Sales      │
│ 2           │ Ethan Chen     │ Operations │
│ 3           │ Julia Lee      │ Hr         │
│ 4           │ Marcus Garcia  │ Product    │
└─────────────┴────────────────┴────────────┘

```

Code it out in the IDE.
