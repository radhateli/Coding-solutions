## Problem

### Practice - Basic query with Where Clause

Listen

Let us combine what we have learnt from our 'SELECT', 'DISTINCT' and 'WHERE' queries.

From the 'Flights' table - let us find the following

- Where the origin of the flight is 'New York'
- Output the passenger_name and gender

```
Expected Output
┌────────────────┬────────┐
│ Passenger_name │ Gender │
├────────────────┼────────┤
│ Dia            │ Female │
│ Jackson        │ Male   │
└────────────────┴────────┘

```

Remember that the column details are as follows

- Passenger_id
- Passenger_name
- Gender
- Origin
- Destination

SELECT passenger_name, gender
FROM Flights
WHERE origin = 'New York'; 
```
